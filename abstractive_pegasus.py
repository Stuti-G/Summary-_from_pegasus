asked if i wanted to play cops and robbers. i accepted of course. now, next to the side of my aunts house is a little area with a small fence, a covered
water tank and super duper sharp stones. my cousin (who was the cop) was gaining on me. i (tried) to jump over the fence, aaand i failed the jump
and went crashing onto the gravel, my leg hitting the sharpest bit and, then the next thing i knew it had a nasty gash."""
